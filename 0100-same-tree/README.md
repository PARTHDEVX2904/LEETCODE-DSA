## Performance

| Metric  | Value   | Beats |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Runtime | 0 ms | `██████████` **100.0%** |
| Memory  | 12.7 MB | `████████░░` **78.3%** |

## Complexity

| | Complexity | Why |
|---|---|---|
| ⏱️ Time  | **O(n)** | recursive traversal, each element visited once |
| 💾 Space | **O(n)** | recursion stack grows with the input |

> ⚠️ _Complexity is **estimated** by static analysis of the code (loop nesting, sorting, recursion) — verify before relying on it._
