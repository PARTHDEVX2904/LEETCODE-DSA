[Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

## Performance

| Metric  | Value   | Beats |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Runtime | 7 ms | `████░░░░░░` **37.7%** |
| Memory  | 46.5 MB | `███░░░░░░░` **28.9%** |

## Complexity

| | Complexity | Why |
|---|---|---|
| ⏱️ Time  | **O(n²)** | two nested loops over the input |
| 💾 Space | **O(n)** | stores input-dependent data in an auxiliary structure |

> ⚠️ _Complexity is **estimated** by static analysis of the code (loop nesting, sorting, recursion) — verify before relying on it._

<summary>📈 How this scales</summary>

**⏱️ Time — `O(n²)`**

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Time growth — O(n²)"
    x-axis "Input size (n)" [10, 100, 500, 1000]
    y-axis "Operations"
    line [100, 10000, 250000, 1000000]
```

| n | 10 | 100 | 500 | 1000 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **operations** | 100 | 10,000 | 250,000 | 1,000,000 |

**💾 Space — `O(n)`**

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Space growth — O(n)"
    x-axis "Input size (n)" [10, 100, 500, 1000]
    y-axis "Auxiliary space"
    line [10, 100, 500, 1000]
```

| n | 10 | 100 | 500 | 1000 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **space units** | 10 | 100 | 500 | 1,000 |
