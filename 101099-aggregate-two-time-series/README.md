## Performance

| Metric  | Value   | Beats |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Runtime | 229 ms | `█████░░░░░` **50.0%** |
| Memory  | 399.6 MB | `██░░░░░░░░` **16.7%** |

## Complexity

| | Complexity | Why |
|---|---|---|
| ⏱️ Time  | **O(n)** | a single pass over the input |
| 💾 Space | **O(n)** | stores input-dependent data in an auxiliary structure |

> ⚠️ _Complexity is **estimated** by static analysis of the code (loop nesting, sorting, recursion) — verify before relying on it._

<summary>📈 How this scales</summary>

**⏱️ Time — `O(n)`**

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Time growth — O(n)"
    x-axis "Input size (n)" [10, 100, 500, 1000]
    y-axis "Operations"
    line [10, 100, 500, 1000]
```

| n | 10 | 100 | 500 | 1000 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **operations** | 10 | 100 | 500 | 1,000 |

**💾 Space — `O(n)`**

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Space growth — O(n)"
    x-axis "Input size (n)" [10, 100, 500, 1000]
    y-axis "Auxiliary space"
    line [10, 100, 500, 1000]
```

| n | 10 | 100 | 500 | 1000 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **space units** | 10 | 100 | 500 | 1,000 |

## Constraints

- `1 <= series1.length, series2.length <= 10^5`
- `series1[i].length == series2[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= series1[i][0], series2[i][0] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= series1[i][1], series2[i][1] <= 10^9`
- `Each series is sorted in strictly increasing order of timestamp.`
