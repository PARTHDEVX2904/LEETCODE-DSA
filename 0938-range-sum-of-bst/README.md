[Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-bst/)

## Performance

| Metric  | Value   | Beats |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Runtime | 2 ms | `█░░░░░░░░░` **14.1%** |
| Memory  | 64.9 MB | `█████████░` **93.8%** |

## Complexity

| | Complexity | Why |
|---|---|---|
| ⏱️ Time  | **O(n)** | recursive traversal, each element visited once |
| 💾 Space | **O(n)** | recursion stack grows with the input |

> ⚠️ _Complexity is **estimated** by static analysis of the code (loop nesting, sorting, recursion) — verify before relying on it._

**⏱️ Time — `O(n)`**

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Time growth — O(n)"
    x-axis "Input size (n)" [10, 100, 500, 1000]
    y-axis "Operations"
    line [10, 100, 500, 1000]
```

| n | 10 | 100 | 500 | 1000 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **operations** | 10 | 100 | 500 | 1,000 |

**💾 Space — `O(n)`**

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Space growth — O(n)"
    x-axis "Input size (n)" [10, 100, 500, 1000]
    y-axis "Auxiliary space"
    line [10, 100, 500, 1000]
```

| n | 10 | 100 | 500 | 1000 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **space units** | 10 | 100 | 500 | 1,000 |
